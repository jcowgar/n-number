How to Properly Form an N-Number

N-Numbers consist of a series of alphanumeric characters. U.S. registration
numbers may not exceed five characters in addition to the standard U.S.
registration prefix letter N. These characters may be:

- One to five numbers (N12345)
- One to four numbers followed by one letter (N1234Z)
- One to three numbers followed by two letters (N123AZ)

To avoid confusion with the numbers one and zero, the letters I and O are not to be used.

Other Requirements

- An N-Number may not begin with zero. You must precede the first zero in an
  N-Number with any number 1 through 9. For example, N01Z is not valid. \*
  Registration numbers N1 through N99 are strictly reserved for FAA internal use.
- The FAA no longer issues numbers beginning with NC, NX, NR, or NL. On some
  older aircraft, these numbers may be displayed in accordance with FAR Part
  45.22.
